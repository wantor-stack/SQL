## Learning SQL

> In this repository I collect some interisting notebooks about SQL Language and some applications with python, SQLite and IBM DB2. They could be an example or a source for those who want to learn how to use the tool or consultation for those who already know!
 
## What's SQL?

> SQL (/ˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/ (About this soundlisten) S-Q-L,[4] /ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel"; Structured Query Language)[5] is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables. (Wikipedia)
